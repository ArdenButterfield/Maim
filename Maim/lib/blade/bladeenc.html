<p><a NAME="Short Description"></a><font size=+2>Short Description</font>
<p>BladeEnc is a program to generate MP3 files from WAV, AIFF or RAW sound
files. BladeEnc is available for most modern computer platforms, including
Windows, Linux, BeOS, MacOS, UnixWare, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
OS/2 and many more.
<p>BladeEnc is free software distributed under the LGPL license and the
sourcecode is available from <a href="http://bladeenc.mp3.no">the homepage</a>
for those who might be interested.
<p>Windows users will find that it looks like a DOS-program, but it is
in fact a true 32-bit Windows application that supports long filenames
etc. This text based interface might be a bit harder for the beginner,
but makes it easy to make automated scripts (like BAT-files) to perform
your tasks and makes BladeEnc a doodle to port to all modern operating
systems except MacOS. A large selection of graphical frontends are available
from my homepage for those who prefer to do their encoding just by moving
and clicking their mouse.
<p>On BladeEnc's&nbsp; homepage you can also find some more detailed information
about BladeEnc, including a FAQ (answers to Frequently Asked Questions),
speed comparisons with other encoders and information about the quality
of MP3s generated by BladeEnc.
<p>You can also go to the link section of <a href="http://bladeenc.mp3.no/">the
homepage</a> if you want some more information about MP3 in general or
needs an MP3 Player.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Quick-Start Guide"></a><font size=+2>Quick-Start Guide</font>
<p>If you just want to turn your WAV/AIFF-files into standard 128 kBit
stereo MP3 files, just drag and drop your files onto BladeEnc.exe (that
is the BladeEnc ICON and not the window that opens if you double click
it).
<p>Once started, BladeEnc will encode the files one by one until finished,
which is a process that can take several hours.
<p>BladeEnc can be stopped any time during the process by pressing CTRL-C
(all systems) or ESC (Windows &amp; OS/2 only).
<p>The resulting MP3-files are put in the same directory as their corresponding
WAV/AIFF-files.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="The More Advanced Users Guide"></a><font size=+2>The More Advanced
Users Guide</font>
<p>BladeEnc is despite its primitive appearance both powerful and easy
to use. It is a console application that takes its parameters from the
commandline. The commandline is where you enter text commands to your computer,
the DOS-Prompt and "Start->Run.."-menu on a Windows system are examples
of commandlines.
<p>Any number of WAV/AIFF-files can be specified on the commandline and
you can even use wildcards to specify more than one file at the same time.
For example will the command "<tt>BladeEnc *.wav</tt>" compress all WAV-files
in the current directory. Long filenames are supported when entering them
on the commandline, but if they include space-characters you will have
to enclose the names with quotation-marks ( " ).
<p>Switches can be entered on the commandline together with the filenames.
In earlier versions of BladeEnc it didn't matter where you put the switches
since they always affected all files anyway, but from BladeEnc 0.80 this
has changed in order to give you more flexibility.
<p>You can get a list of all valid arguments by running BladeEnc without
any commandline arguments (for example by double-clicking on its icon).
<p>If you feel that you need a temporary performance boost to your system
you can pause the process by pressing ESC (Windows &amp; OS/2) or CTRL-Z
(Linux and other UNICES).
<p>To run BladeEnc from the commandline you should place BladeEnc.exe where
your system automatically finds it, for example your Windows directory.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="The Configuration File"></a><font size=+2>The Configuration
File</font>
<p>The default settings of BladeEnc can be changed in the configuration
file. On Windows and BeOS systems this configuration file is called bladeenc.cfg
and <b>should always be placed in the same directory as BladeEnc.exe</b>.
On a Unix system it is called .bladeencrc and should be placed in your
home directory.
<p>The config file contains the same kind of switches as you enter on the
commandline, separated by one or more spaces, tabs or newlines.
<p>Anything placed after a '#' until the end of the line is believed to
be a comment and is ignored.
<p>The switches in the configuration file are simply appended to the beginning
of the commandline before it is parsed.
<p>Anything typed on the commandline has higher priority than what is in
the configuration file, so the default settings can easily be overriden
from the commandline.
<p>If the -nocfg switch is entered on the commandline the configuration
file will be ignored. The -nocfg switch is not allowed in the configuration
file.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="The Structure of The Commandline Arguments"></a><font size=+2>The
Structure of The Commandline Arguments</font>
<p>The way the commandline is interpreted by BladeEnc has changed in version
0.80 in order to make it all more flexible and powerful and should work
nicely with most older frontends. Also, the l3enc emulation mode has been
removed, so it doesn't distinguish between l3enc- and BladeEnc commandlines
anymore, but should be able to understand both anyway.
<p>On the commandline you specify the files you want to encode, together
with any switches to control the process and optionally the name of the
output files. Most switches can be applied both globally, which makes them
affect all the files, or locally, which makes them affect only one file.
<br>Switches that only affects the general behaviour of BladeEnc and don't
affect the output of the encoding process, can only be specified globally
(like -quiet).
<p>The commandline is read by BladeEnc following these simple rules:
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
Files to be encoded are specified on the commandline.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><i>Example:&nbsp;</i><b><tt> bladeenc track1.wav track2.wav</tt></b><i>
will first encode the file track1.wav and then track2.wav.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
If an input file is immediately followed by a filename ending with ".mp3"
that will be the output name of the encoded file. If it isn't followed
by a filename ending with ".mp3", the output file will get the same name
as the input file, but substituting the extension with ".mp3".</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><i>Example:&nbsp; </i><b><tt>bladeenc track1.wav track2.wav output2.mp3</tt></b><i>
will first encode track1.wav into track1.mp3 and then encode track2.wav
into output2.mp3.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Switches that are placed before the first input file are considered global
and will affect all the specified files.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><i>Example:&nbsp;</i><b><tt> bladeenc -crc -160 track1.wav track2.wav
</tt></b><i>will
generate 160 kBit MP3 files with checksums of both input files.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Switches that are placed anywhere else will only affect the preceding input
file.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><i>Example:&nbsp;</i><b><tt> bladeenc track1.wav -crc -160 track2.wav
-mono
</tt></b><i>will generate a 160 kBit MP3 file with embedded checksum
of track1.wav and a 128 kBit mono MP3 file of track2.wav (128 kBit is the
default bitrate).</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Local switches have higher priority than global switches.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><i>Example:&nbsp;</i><b><tt> bladeenc -160 track1.wav -256 track2.wav</tt></b><i>
will generate a 256 kBit mp3 file of track1.wav and a 160 kBit mp3 file
of track2.wav.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Local switches must be placed after any specified output file. They may
not be placed between the input and output file.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><i>Example:&nbsp;</i><b><tt> bladeenc track1.wav output1.mp3 -256</tt></b><i>
will work just fine, but</i><b><tt> bladeenc track1.wav -256 output1.mp3
</tt></b><i>will
just confuse bladeenc and generate an error message.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Stdin can be specified as input by simply substituting the name of the
input file with <b>stdin</b>. This will make bladeenc read the input from
a redirection or pipe instead.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><i>Example: </i><b><tt>bladeenc stdin output.mp3 </tt></b><i>will encode
the file coming through stdin and put the result in output.mp3.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Stdout can be specified as output by simply substituting the name of the
output file with <b>stdout</b>. This will make bladeenc send the&nbsp;
generated MP3 file through the standard output stream.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><i>Example:</i>&nbsp;<b><tt> bladeenc track1.wav stdout </tt></b><i>will
encode track1.wav and send the mp3 file through the standard output stream.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
And all this can be combined into one big operation.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>Example: <b><tt>bladeenc -160 track1.wav stdout -mono track2.wav track3.wav
output.mp3 -crc stdin stdout -112 </tt></b><i>will do all the following:
Encode track1.wav into a 160 kBit mono mp3 that is sent to stdout. Encode
track2.wav into a 160 kBit mp3 named track2.mp3. Encode track3.wav into
a 160 kBit mp3 with CRC named output.mp3. Encode what comes through the
stdin into a 112 kBit mp3 that is appended to the data that is already
sent to stdout.</i></ol>

<p><br><a NAME="Commandline Switches"></a><font size=+2>Commandline Switches</font>
<p>All commandline switches are case-insensitive, so you can enter them
in either upper- or lower-case.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=8 >
<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-[bitrate],
<br>-br [bitrate]</td>

<td>Defines the bitrate for the MP3-file. Higher bitrates gives better
quality, but also bigger files. Most people prefer to generate 128 kBit
MP3s. Please note that it's the total bitrate that is specified, so if
you're generating a stereo MP3-file at 128 kBit you get 64 kBit for left
channel and 64 kBit for the right channel. The default setting is 128 kBit
for stereo files and 64 kBit for mono files.&nbsp;
<p>Allowed bitrates are: 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192,
224, 256 and 320.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-concat</td>

<td>Concatenates the output generated from this file to the last mp3 generated,
thus making one mp3 file from two or more sample files. This option also
automatically enables -nogap.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-crc</td>

<td>Adds checksum data to each frame in the MP3 file. The checksum data
is useful for error-correction when streaming the MP3 in realtime over
internet (as done by internet radio stations). It lowers the quality of
the sound slightly since the checksum data also needs to fit in the specified
bitrate and is not needed for normal use.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-delete,
<br>-del</td>

<td>The WAV-file is automatically deleted after having been encoded. Be
careful with this switch because the WAV-file is deleted even if the encoding
process failed (for example due to insufficient drive space).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-mono,
<br>-dm</td>

<td>Downmixes stereo input files to mono before they are compressed, thus
generating mono MP3 files. This switch does nothing if the input file already
is mono.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-leftmono,
<br>-lm</td>

<td>Takes only the left channel of the input file and encodes it into a
mono MP3. If the input file is mono it will be compressed as it is.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-rightmono,
<br>-rm</td>

<td>Takes only the right channel of the input file and encodes it into
a mono MP3. If the input file is mono it will be compressed as it is.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-swap</td>

<td>Swaps the left and right channels of stereo input files before encoding
them.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-private,
<br>-p</td>

<td>Sets the private-flag in the MP3-file, specifying that this is a private
MP3. As far as I know there is no program that treats private MP3's differently
from normal ones so it is practically useless.&nbsp;
<p>Setting this flag doesn't affect the encoding time, file size or quality
in any way, so set it if it makes you happy.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-copyright,
<br>-c</td>

<td>Sets the copyright-flag in the MP3-file, specifying that this is a
copyrighted MP3. As far as I know there is no program that treats copyrighted
MP3's differently from normal ones so it is practically useless.&nbsp;
<p>Setting this flag doesn't affect the encoding time, filesize or quality
in any way, so set it if it makes you happy.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-copy</td>

<td>This switch clears the MP3 file's original-flag that is set by default
from version 0.50 of BladeEnc.&nbsp;
<p>Clearing the original-flag doesn't affect the encoding time, filesize
or quality in any way, so do it if it makes you happy.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-quiet</td>

<td>Prevents BladeEnc from doing any screen output, except for error messages.
This is mostly useful if you want to run bladeenc as a background process
on UNIX systems. The screen output takes nearly no time at all, so you
won't even save 1% by disabling screen output.<b> This switch is global
only.</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-quit,
<br>-q</td>

<td>Makes BladeEnc quit automatically when all files have been encoded.
Normally BladeEnc waits for someone to press RETURN before quitting. <b>This
switch is global only.</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-outdir=[path]</td>

<td>Specifies an output path for the encoded files. Normally the MP3 files
ends up in the same directory as their corresponding WAV-files resides
in, but using this switch you can get them to end up wherever you like.
<b>This
switch is global only.</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-prio=[setting]</td>

<td>Changes the task priority of BladeEnc. Valid settings are HIGHEST,
HIGHER, NORMAL, LOWER, LOWEST and IDLE. BladeEnc is by default set to LOWEST
priority which basically means that BladeEnc functions fine in the background
without disturbing or slowing down any other program. Linux/Unix users
can also specify prio in the normal unix range of -20 to +20.<b>This switch
is global only.</b>
<br><i>This setting is not available in all ports.</i></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-rawfreq=[frequency]</td>

<td>Specifies the frequency for raw samples in hertz. Default is 44100.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-rawbits=[samplebits]</td>

<td>Specifies the number of bits for each sample in a raw sample file.
Allowed values are 8 and 16. Default is 16.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-rawmono</td>

<td>Specifies that raw samples are mono, not stereo.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-rawstereo</td>

<td>Specifies that raw samples are stereo, not mono. This is default, so
you won't have to use this switch unless you want to override a global
-rawmono switch.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-rawsigned</td>

<td>Specifies that raw samples are signed, i.e. contains values in the
range -32768 to +32767 (16-bit samples) or -128 to +127 (8-bit samples).
This is default, so you won't have to use this switch unless you want to
override a global -rawunsigned switch.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-rawunsigned</td>

<td>Specifies that raw samples are unsigned, i.e. contains values in the
range 0 to 65535 (16-bit samples) or 0 to 255 (8-bit samples).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-rawbyteorder=[LITTLE/BIG]</td>

<td>Specifies the byteorder of raw samples. LITTLE gives LITTLE_ENDIAN
(Intel x86 style) and BIG gives BIG_ENDIAN (Motorola style). Default is
whatever is the native byteorder for your system, so hopefully you won't
have to use this switch.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-rawchannels=[1/2]</td>

<td>Specifies the number of channels in a raw sample. -rawchannels=1 gives
the same result as -rawmono and -rawchannels=2 give the same result as
-rawstereo. Default is 2.</td>
</tr>

<td VALIGN=TOP>-nocfg</td>

<td>Ignore whatever is specified in the config file. <b>This switch is
global only.</b></td>
</tr>

<td VALIGN=TOP>-refresh=[1+]</td>

<td><i>This switch is not supported anymore. It became superfluous due
to internal changes. BladeEnc still understands (but ignores) it for compatibility
reasons.</i></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-progress=[0-8]</td>

<td>Specifies which of the 7 available progress indicators to use or turns
the progress indicator off if set to 0. The default progress indicator
is number 1. Changing the progress indicator doesn't affect the encoding
in any way it just lets you configure the look of BladeEnc a little bit
according to your own taste:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
Percentage and ETA shown for file and batch (default).</li>

<li>
Long bar for file progress.</li>

<li>
Long bar for batch progress.</li>

<li>
Short bars for file and batch progress.</li>

<li>
Samples done/total for file and batch.</li>

<li>
ETA shown for file and batch.</li>

<li>
Seconds of MP3 generated from file (default for RAW samples).</li>

<li>
Alternative long bar for file progress. Doesn't rewind the cursor so it
produces less output and works well when redirecting program output to
a file.</li>
</ol>
If a RAW sample is included in the batch you automatically gets progress
indicator 7 for technical reasons. <b>This switch is global only.</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-nogap</td>

<td>Specifies that there should be no audiable gap between this and the
next sample if they are played after each other. Useful when encoding records
where the tracks blend into each other, but can cause unwanted side effects
otherwise. Please see the section "Gapless encoding" below for more information.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-sort</td>

<td>Sorts the specified input files according to filename before encoding
them. Useful when using the -nogap switch combined with wildcards since
it's critical that the tracks are encoded in the right order when doing
gapless encoding. <b>This switch is global only.</b></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><a NAME="Gapless Encoding"></a><font size=+2>Gapless Encoding</font>
<p>From version 0.92.5 BladeEnc supports what we refer to as gapless encoding.
<p>You might have noticed that you normally get a few milliseconds of silence
in the beginning and end of each encoded track. This is normally not a
problem, but when you have encode a record where the songs blends into
each other (like Enigma and most live albums) and listen to the mp3s you
can hear a short pause or click between the tracks which can be quite anoying.
<p>There are some technical reasons for this which has made it quite hard
to solve, but by using a few tricks and allowing a few milliseconds of
music to be moved from the end of one track and onto the beginning of the
next, we can make sure that we don't get any gaps.
<p>The downside of this is that if you encode two totally unrelated tracks
where the first one ends very sharply and the next one begins with silence,
we can unwantedly get a short click in the beginning of the second track
since it starts with some milliseconds of music that isn't intended to
be there.
<p>The sollution was therefore to by default disable gapless encoding and
let the user enable it where wanted by using the -nogap switch.
<p>The -nogap switch can either be placed as a global switch, specifying
that all tracks should blend into each other or as a local switch if just
two of the tracks should blend into each other.
<p><b>Example:</b>
<p><b>1.</b>&nbsp; <tt>bladeenc track01.wav track02.wav track03.wav -nogap
track04.wav track05.wav</tt>
<blockquote><i>Only the transition between track03 and track04 is made
gapless, only track04 'steals'&nbsp; a few milliseconds from track03.</i></blockquote>

<p><br><b>2.</b>&nbsp; <tt>bladeenc -nogap track01.wav track02.wav track03.wav
track04.wav track05.wav</tt>
<blockquote><i>All the tracks are made to blend into each other, taking
a few milliseconds of music from the previous one.</i></blockquote>

<p><br><b>Please note the following!:</b>
<p><b>1.</b> The tracks must be specified in the correct play order when
using -nogap, otherwise you will get a few milliseconds of the wrong track,
probably causing a loud click between the tracks.
<p><b>2.</b> All the tracks that should blend into each other needs to
be encoded in the same session. You can't encode them one by one with the
-nogap switch.
<p><b>3.</b> Some records have pre- and post-gaps between the songs. This
normally causes a few milliseconds of music being lost between the tracks
allready under the CD extraction process and can't be undone by BladeEnc.
The .mp3 files won't blend better into each other than the .wav/.aiff files.
<p><b>4. Many mp3 players do NOT support gapless replay!</b> Even if there
is no silence in the beginning or end of the tracks they still pause briefly
between the tracks. The only player that I know of which doesn't pause
at all is mpg123 (Unix and Windows commandline player) but there are probably
more and hopefully will many players be fixed once more gapless mp3 files
start to circulate. There is also supposed to be a gapless output plugin
for WinAmp.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="L3Enc Emulation Mode"></a><font size=+2>L3Enc Emulation Mode</font>
<p>The l3enc emulation mode of older versions of BladeEnc has been removed
in BladeEnc 0.80 since the new way of reading the commandline in this version
makes it understand l3enc commandlines anyway.
<p>Just remember that the default bitrate of BladeEnc is 128 kBit, while
l3enc uses 112 kBit.
<p>However, two small tricks were necessary to make BladeEnc compatible
with l3enc:
<ol>
<li>
If the specified bitrate is over 1000 it is divided by 1000 in order to
convert it from bits/sec to kBit/sec.</li>

<li>
If l3enc's -hq switch is placed on the commandline or a bitrate over 1000
is specified locally using the -br switch, BladeEnc automatically activates
the -quit switch.</li>
</ol>
